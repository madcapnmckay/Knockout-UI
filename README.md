**Knockout UI** is a collection of UI components based on [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) and [JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/). 

The goal of this project is to collect together a number of useful widgets that can be reused and expanded by the community and to act as a learning tool for people looking for more advanced examples of how to use knockout.

I started to learn Knockout in Dec 2010 and built a some successful UI's with it. I had a number of components lying around so I thought I would start this project to share what I had and get feedback and suggestions from the Knockout community. 

Most of the components use existing JQuery UI functionality where possible (e.g Autocomplete). Hence this project is not framework agnostic.

I hope you find something useful here.
